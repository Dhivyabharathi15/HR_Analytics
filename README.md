**HR Workforce Analytics Dashboard**

**1. Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing the organization’s workforce data to understand employee demographics, compensation structure, performance patterns, hiring quality, and attrition trends. The dashboard enables HR teams to make better decisions on hiring, training, retention, and workforce allocation.

**2. Business Objective**

The HR department needed a clear view of:

Workforce distribution across locations & departments

Performance and experience levels of employees

Compensation and benefits usage

Attrition trends and potential retention concerns

Education and skill diversity

This dashboard helps provide quick, visual insights for HR strategy and decision-making.

**3. Dataset Used**

The project uses four main datasets that cover employee details, compensation, performance, and department structure. 

The _Employee dataset_ includes core employee information such as demographics, education, joining dates, relieving dates, and work locations.

The _Compensation dataset_ provides salary-related information including monthly income, allowances, bonuses, and benefits availed.

The _Performance dataset_ contains employee productivity indicators like tasks completed, ratings, projects handled, and promotions earned over the years.

The _Department dataset_ maps employees to their departments and provides department names and leadership details. 

Together, these datasets give a complete view of workforce behavior and employee lifecycle.

**4. Employee Hire Quality – Key Insights**

_Skill Relevance_: New hires were evaluated on how well their skills and qualifications match their job roles. Higher alignment generally led to better performance outcomes.

_Onboarding Completion_: Completion of onboarding and training modules within expected timelines was used as an indicator of readiness and adaptability.

_Probation Success Rate_: The proportion of employees who successfully completed probation reflects strong hiring decisions and effective role fit.

_Performance in First 6 Months_: Early-stage performance ratings were assessed to understand the quality of hiring and the effectiveness of initial deployment.

_Retention of New Hires_: Higher retention rates among new employees indicate strong job satisfaction and good hiring alignment.

_Feedback from Managers_: Manager feedback regarding new hire confidence, attitude, and learning curve helps validate hiring decisions.

_Training Support Needed_: Candidates requiring minimal additional training after onboarding were considered stronger hires.
